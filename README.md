# CODE100 2023 Coding Challenges

[CODE100](https://code100.dev) is a coding competition where the challengers have to prove their knowledge and coding skills. Some of the rounds are quizzes and buzzer questions, while others are language-agnostic coding challenges.

Due to popular demand, we are publishing the challenges and solutions of the 2023 edition of CODE100. The challenges are published in the `challenges` folder.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Challenge 1 (from round 3 of the competition)

### Example puzzle
`world20congresss23`
### Example solution
`43`  (not `7`)

**The solution you should submit is the sum of these numbers.**
